Dieter's freeware tools
=======================

A download space for my old barcode related tools.

Here I am going to provide tools I had written in previous years before my retirement.

Currently these tools are written for Windows 10 and older. I did not bother for Windows 11 yet and probably never will.

If someone wants the sources, feel free to ask. Currently I am too lazy to provide the sources here on Github.

    No need for an installer, just unzip and run.
